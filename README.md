# Deno WebSocket Server ðŸ”Œ

A WebSocket server library for [Deno](https://deno.land).

The [raison d'Ãªtre](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27%C3%AAtre) for this library is to provide a unified async iterator for the events of all connected WebSocket clients.
The way it does this is through a custom [MuxAsyncInfiniteIterator](mux_async_infinite_iterator.ts) (based on the [MuxAsyncIterator](https://deno.land/std/async/mux_async_iterator.ts)), which multiplexes multiple async iterators into a single stream.

**Note**: This WebSocket server is **not** an `EventEmitter` (i.e. it does not use events with callbacks like [websockets/ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws)).
Instead, it specifies the [asyncIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator) symbol and should be used in conjunction with a [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loop, just like the [Deno http server](https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts).
The iterator yields `WebSocketServerEvent`s which contain both the `WebSocketEvent` and the corresponding `WebSocket` from which the event was received.

## Usage

### Simple server
```typescript
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/x/websocket_server/mod.ts'
const server = serve(":8080");
for await (const { event } of server) {
  console.log(event);
}
```

### Echo / broadcast server

## FAQ

### How do I create a WebSocket client?
This library provides a class only for WebSocket servers, not WebSocket clients, because it is straightforward to create clients with the [std/ws](https://deno.land/std/ws/) module.

Here is a simple example:
```typescript
import { connectWebSocket } from "https://deno.land/std/ws/mod.ts";
try {
  const socket = await connectWebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080");
  for await (const event of socket) {
    console.log(event);
    if (typeof event === "string" && event === "Who is this?") {
      socket.send("It is me, a simple WebSocket client.");
    }
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Could not connect to WebSocket: '${err}'`);
}
```
